Simple C++ library for file reading and writing, which is wrapper around standart file reading and writing library.

## About

This library attempts to simplify work with files through standard file IO library, while making such interaction secure. Maintains good functions documentation and aims to prevent possible problems due to misusage of own functions. (for example, usage of binary functions in non-binary mode) Be warned that nothing can ensure safety and security more than your brain.
